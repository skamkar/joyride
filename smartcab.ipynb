    "Welcome to the fourth project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, template code has already been provided for you to aid in your analysis of the *Smartcab* and your implemented learning algorithm. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. There will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and the visualizations provided in the notebook. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide in `agent.py`.  \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a *Smartcab* through its environment towards a goal. Since the *Smartcab* is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: **Safety** and **Reliability**. A driving agent that gets the *Smartcab* to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered **unsafe**. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered **unreliable**. Maximizing the driving agent's **safety** and **reliability** would ensure that *Smartcabs* have a permanent place in the transportation industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety** and **Reliability** are measured using a letter-grade system as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Grade \t| Safety \t| Reliability \t|\n",
    "|:-----:\t|:------:\t|:-----------:\t|\n",
    "|   A+  \t|  Agent commits no traffic violations,<br/>and always chooses the correct action. | Agent reaches the destination in time<br />for 100% of trips. |\n",
    "|   A   \t|  Agent commits few minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 90% of trips. |\n",
    "|   B   \t| Agent commits frequent minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 80% of trips. |\n",
    "|   C   \t|  Agent commits at least one major traffic violation,<br/> such as driving through a red light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 70% of trips. |\n",
    "|   D   \t| Agent causes at least one minor accident,<br/> such as turning left on green with oncoming traffic.       \t| Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",
    "|   F   \t|  Agent causes at least one major accident,<br />such as driving through a red light with cross-traffic.      \t| Agent fails to reach the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",

    "### Understand the World\n",
    "Before starting to work on implementing your driving agent, it's necessary to first understand the world (environment) which the *Smartcab* and driving agent work in. One of the major components to building a self-learning agent is understanding the characteristics about the agent, which includes how the agent operates. To begin, simply run the `agent.py` agent code exactly how it is -- no need to make any additions whatsoever. Let the resulting simulation run for some time to see the various working components. Note that in the visual simulation (if enabled), the **white vehicle** is the *Smartcab*."

    "In a few sentences, describe what you observe during the simulation when running the default `agent.py` agent code. Some things you could consider:\n",
    "- *Does the Smartcab move at all during the simulation?*\n",
    "- *What kind of rewards is the driving agent receiving?*\n",
    "- *How does the light changing color affect the rewards?*  \n",

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Smartcab does not move during the simulation. By default, the Smartcab (labeled with the Udacity logo) remains stationary at its initial intersection.\n",
    "- Random seeding is applied to the problem, i.e., the Smartcab is placed in a different starting position with each simulation, likewise, starting positions and travel directions by other cars are randomly seeded as well.\n",
    "- Visual information is quite coarse, e.g., turn-signals are not apparent on other cars (difficult to tell if on-coming traffic are making left turns, in which case, a Smartcab left turn would be allowable as well). Also relative velocities are hard to discern, e.g., if stopped at a red light, wishing to make a legal right turn, it's unclear how much time the Smartcar has before right-of-way traffic headed towards the intersection actually passes through it.\n",
    "- Floating point rewards (> 0) and penalities (0 <) are being assigned to the Smartcab after each time-step based on its previous action.\n",
    "- Penalities (negative rewards) are expected, e.g., idling at a green light with no oncoming traffic, as well are rewards, e.g., idling at red light.\n",
    "- Assigned rewards are not consistently valued, e.g., the following sequential rewards were observed: idling at a green light with no oncoming traffic was penalized (-5.83), but continuing to idle at the same green light lessened slightly (-5.59), and then worsened (-5.95). Idling at a green light with oncoming traffic was provided marginal reward (0.0 ~ 2.0). Idling at a red light provided a larger reward (1 ~ 3)."

    "In addition to understanding the world, it is also necessary to understand the code itself that governs how the world, simulation, and so on operate. Attempting to create a driving agent would be difficult without having at least explored the *\"hidden\"* devices that make everything work. In the `/smartcab/` top-level directory, there are two folders: `/logs/` (which will be used later) and `/smartcab/`. Open the `/smartcab/` folder and explore each Python file included, then answer the following question."

    "## Implement a Basic Driving Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent is getting the agent to actually take valid actions. In this case, a valid action is one of `None`, (do nothing) `'Left'` (turn left), `'Right'` (turn right), or `'Forward'` (go forward). For your first implementation, navigate to the `'choose_action()'` agent function and make the driving agent randomly choose one of these actions. Note that you have access to several class variables that will help you write this functionality, such as `'self.learning'` and `'self.valid_actions'`. Once implemented, run the agent file and simulation briefly to confirm that your driving agent is taking a random action each time step."

    "### Basic Agent Simulation Results\n",
    "To obtain results from the initial simulation, you will need to adjust following flags:\n",
    "- `'enforce_deadline'` - Set this to `True` to force the driving agent to capture whether it reaches the destination in time.\n",
    "- `'update_delay'` - Set this to a small value (such as `0.01`) to reduce the time between steps in each trial.\n",
    "- `'log_metrics'` - Set this to `True` to log the simluation results as a `.csv` file in `/logs/`.\n",
    "- `'n_test'` - Set this to `'10'` to perform 10 testing trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you may disable to the visual simulation (which can make the trials go faster) by setting the `'display'` flag to `False`. Flags that have been set here should be returned to their default setting when debugging. It is important that you understand what each flag does and how it affects the simulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have successfully completed the initial simulation (there should have been 20 training trials and 10 testing trials), run the code cell below to visualize the results. Note that log files are overwritten when identical simulations are run, so be careful with what log file is being loaded!\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* *How frequently is the driving agent making bad decisions? How many of those bad decisions cause accidents?*\n",
    "  * On average, the agent is making bad decisions ~40% of the time.\n",
    "  * On average, ~25% of these bad decisions are causing accidents, i.e., ~10% of all decisions lead to accidents.\n",
    "* *Given that the agent is driving randomly, does the rate of reliabilty make sense?*\n",
    "  * Somewhat; it can certainly be justified. Given the actions (4 choices: None, L, R, F) and environment (traffic lights and other traffic), it seems like bad behavior is a bit of a coin flip. Let's further rationalize this:\n",
    "      * Assume that agent is equally likely (p = 0.5) of encountering red or green light\n",
    "      * For green lights, R, F, are always valid actions. Additionally, when there is no oncoming traffic (assume 80% of the time), L is also valid. \n",
    "      * For red lights, None is always a valid action, as is R with no oncoming traffic (assume 80% of the time).\n",
    "      * Computing the probabilities of success, if we assume R, F, L, None are all equally likely of occurring, for green lights, we're reliable 65% of the time (unreliable 35%); for red lights, a reliablilty of 45% is obtained (55% unreliable).\n",
    "      * Averaging the unreliable probabilities for both light situations (since either is equally likely), the unreliable rate is 45%. Quite close to the ~40% observed!\n",
    "* *What kind of rewards is the agent receiving for its actions? Do the rewards suggest it has been penalized heavily?*\n",
    "  * On average, the rewards are negative, and close to -5, which suggests that it has been heavily penalized.\n",
    "* *As the number of trials increases, does the outcome of results change significantly?*\n",
    "  * Several observations can be made:\n",
    "     * _Frequency of bad actions_, _exploration factor_, and _learning factor_ remain consistent over all trials.\n",
    "     * Although there is some scatter with _average reward per action_ and _rate of reliability_, rerunning this simulation multiple times demonstrated no correlation to age of trial.\n",
    "* *Would this Smartcab be considered safe and/or reliable for its passengers? Why or why not?*\n",
    "  * In no universe would this Smartcab be considered safe or reliable -- unless it's competing in a destruction derby, then yes.. Actions have a 40% chance of being violations or accidents - incredibly dangerous! Worse yet, the agent never achieves a reliability score above 20% -- abysmal. You'd likely accomplish similar performance while driving drunk, blindfolded, with earplugs, covered in ants."

    "## Inform the Driving Agent\n",
    "The second step to creating an optimized Q-learning driving agent is defining a set of states that the agent can occupy in the environment. Depending on the input, sensory data, and additional variables available to the driving agent, a set of states can be defined for the agent so that it can eventually *learn* what action it should take when occupying a state. The condition of `'if state then action'` for each state is called a **policy**, and is ultimately what the driving agent is expected to learn. Without defining states, the driving agent would never understand which action is most optimal -- or even what environmental variables and conditions it cares about!"

    "* `'input'` is the only one that prescribes what manuevers can safely be performed.\n",
    "* `'waypoint'` is the only feature that can direct the smartcar along the correct direction of travel. Not knowning the final destination turns the policy into a random walk, where we hope to (randomly) arrive at the destination.\n",

    "When defining a set of states that the agent can occupy, it is necessary to consider the *size* of the state space. That is to say, if you expect the driving agent to learn a **policy** for each state, you would need to have an optimal action for *every* state the agent can occupy. If the number of all possible states is very large, it might be the case that the driving agent never learns what to do in some states, which can lead to uninformed decisions.

Of course, additional benefits come from Q-Learning, such that we can have the agent choose the *best* action for each state based on the Q-values of each state-action pair possible.

Now that the Q-Learning algorithm is implemented and the driving agent is successfully learning, it's necessary to tune settings and adjust learning paramaters so the driving agent learns both **safety** and **efficiency**. Typically this step will require a lot of trial and error, as some settings will invariably make the learning worse. One thing to keep in mind is the act of learning itself and the time that this takes: In theory, we could allow the agent to learn for an incredibly long amount of time; however, another goal of Q-Learning is to *transition from experimenting with unlearned behavior to acting on learned behavior*. For example, always allowing the agent to perform a random action during training (if $\\epsilon = 1$ and never decays) will certainly make it *learn*, but never let it *act*.

Here, however, you can concretely define what it is the agent is trying to learn, and that is the U.S. right-of-way traffic laws. Since these laws are known information, you can further define, for each state the *Smartcab* is occupying, the optimal action for the driving agent based on these laws. In that case, we call the set of optimal state-action pairs an **optimal policy**. Hence, unlike some theoretical answers, it is clear whether the agent is acting \"incorrectly\" not only by the reward (penalty) it receives, but also by pure observation. If the agent drives through a red light, we both see it receive a negative reward but also know that it is not the correct behavior. This can be used to your advantage for verifying whether the **policy** your driving agent has learned is the correct one, or if it is a **suboptimal policy**."
